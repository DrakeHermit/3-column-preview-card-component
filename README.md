## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to work better with flexbox to make this 3 column card challenge possible. I managed to make it responsive for mobile devices but I have yet to make it responsive for tablet like devices.

### Continued development

I want to work on bigger projects in the future where there are more components to think about.
